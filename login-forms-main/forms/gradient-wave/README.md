## Customization

### Gradient Color Palette
```css
/* Primary Gradients */
background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #667eea, #764ba2, #f093fb, #f5576c);

/* Wave Colors */
rgba(255,255,255,0.1) /* Light wave overlay */
rgba(255,255,255,0.05) /* Subtle wave overlay */

/* Interactive Elements */
rgba(255,255,255,0.2) /* Button and input backgrounds */
rgba(255,255,255,0.3) /* Focused state backgrounds */
```

### Animation Timing
- **Background Gradient**: 15s infinite flow
- **Wave Layers**: 20s-35s varying speeds
- **Particles**: 15s float cycles
- **Ripples**: 0.6s-0.8s duration
- **Input Waves**: 1s flow animation

### Wave Customization
- **Wave Count**: 4 layered background waves
- **Wave Speed**: Customizable animation duration
- **Wave Opacity**: Adjustable transparency levels
- **Wave Direction**: Forward and reverse options

## Visual Effects

### Background System
- **Flowing Gradients**: 4-color gradient animation
- **Layered Waves**: Multiple wave overlays with different speeds
- **Particle Animation**: 6 floating particles with individual timing
- **Ambient Glow**: Dynamic lighting based on interaction

### Interactive Elements
- **Input Waves**: Flowing wave effects on focus
- **Button Ripples**: Expanding ripple animations on click
- **Card Tilt**: 3D perspective tilt following mouse movement
- **Gradient Checkbox**: Animated gradient fill on selection

### Transition Effects
- **Wave Shake**: Error states with wave-like shake
- **Success Wave**: Full-screen success wave animation
- **Loading Waves**: Vertical wave bars for loading states
- **Social Waves**: Flowing effects on social button hover

## Performance Considerations

- **Hardware Acceleration**: All animations use CSS transforms
- **Optimized Particles**: Minimal DOM manipulation for particles
- **Efficient Gradients**: Uses CSS background-size for smooth animation
- **Debounced Events**: Mouse events optimized for performance

## Browser Support

- Chrome 88+ (recommended for best effects)
- Firefox 103+ (full support)
- Safari 15.4+ (webkit prefixes included)
- Edge 88+ (full support)

Requires modern CSS support for backdrop-filter, gradients, and transforms.
